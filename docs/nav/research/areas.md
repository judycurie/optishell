# Research Areas


We are interested in conducting and collaborating in research projects broadly in the following areas:

- digital fabrication, rapid prototyping, 3D scanning
	- smart fabrication of materials and building components
	- creation of the economic housing unit that can be produced by fablabs
	- recycle: recyclable & biomaterials for digital fabrication
	- reuse: creation of 3D libraries of the available second-hand materials
      - establishing matching processes for the best material economy


- computational design, design optimization, multidisciplinary optimization
  	- structural art (elegant, efficient & economic structures)
	- form-finding
	- optimization of Life Cycle Costs of a design (as a balance between energy used and CO2 emitted to produce, transport, fabricate, construct, and finally utilize the design)

- design workflow, automation and software
	- design for fabrication 4.0
	- construction on blockchain

- visual & digital art
	- AI-based art
	- generative processes with human input
